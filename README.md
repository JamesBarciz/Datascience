## AirBnB Application

For this project, our goal is to accurately predict the price of a potential listing for AirBnB in the city of Berlin, Germany.

**DS Unit3 Portion** [*Heroku Application*](https://airbnb-berlin-price-predict.herokuapp.com/).

## Data Science Unit 3

Our main objectives as part of dspt3-Unit_3 were to:

1. Obtain a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/brittabettendorf/berlin-airbnb-data) pertinent to Berlin AirBnB listings and extract important features needed to make the app as accurate as possible both in genuineness and predictiveness.

2. Relay said features to the Back End web developer to help create the schema to be used for the database they will build using PostgreSQL.

3. Make predictions accessible to the team by deploying a Flask API to receive inputs and output predicted optimal price in JSON format.
